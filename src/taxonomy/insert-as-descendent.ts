 * Inserts `insertee` into the taxonomy subgraph rooted at `ancestor`, preserving all invariants
 * relating to the arrangement of taxonomy nodes. `insertee`'s pattern is assumed to be a proper
 * subset of `ancestor`'s pattern, and `insertee` must not hold the empty pattern '∅'.
 * @param {TaxonomyNode} insertee - the new node to be inserted into the taxonomy below `ancestor`.
 * @param {TaxonomyNode} ancestor - the root node of the taxonomy subgraph in which `insertee` belongs.
 * @param {(pattern: Pattern) => TaxonomyNode} nodeFor - a function that returns the taxonomy node for
 *        a given pattern. It is expected to return the same instance when passed the same pattern for
 *        the same taxonomy. When `insertee` overlaps an existing node in the subgraph, this function
 *        is used to synthesize the additional intersection node(s).
