 * - 2 (Subset): every pathname matched by `patternA` is also matched by `patternB`
 * - 3 (Superset): every pathname matched by `patternB` is also matched by `patternA`
 * - 4 (Disjoint): no pathname is matched by both `patternA` and `patternB`
 * - 5 (Overlapping): none of the other four relationships are true.
 *
 * NB: `patternA` and `patternB` are assumed to be in normal form.
 * NB: The operation is case-sensitive.
